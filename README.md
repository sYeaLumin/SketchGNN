# SketchGNN: Semantic Sketch Segmentation with Graph Neural Networks

We introduce *SketchGNN*, a convolutional graph neural network for semantic segmentation and labeling of freehand vector sketches. We treat an input stroke-based sketch as a graph, with nodes representing the sampled points along input strokes and edges encoding the stroke structure information. *SketchGNN* significantly improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods for semantic sketch segmentation and has magnitudes fewer parameters than both image-based and sequence-based methods.
